" *** SYNTAX GROUP: reST section highlighting.

function! s:DubsClr_rstSections()
  " reST header syntax can use any of the 32 punctation keys found on a US keyboard:
  "
  "   ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
  "
  " The documentation recommends using a subset of those, because "some characters
  " are more suitable than others":
  "
  "   = - ` : . ' " ~ ^ _ * + #
  "
  " Omitted from included rst syntax runtime:
  "
  "   ! $ % & ( ) , / ; < > ? @ [ \ ] { | }
  "
  " Although I'd respond that that's really user preference, and that the syntax
  " plugin should honor what reST itself honors. (I'd concede this might not be
  " the case if certain punctuation is used in a way that's not for headerizing,
  " but that might be interpreted as such, e.g., a merge conflict uses angle
  " brackets in such a way:
  "
  "   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  "   some code
  "   ==============
  "   other code
  "   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  "
  " and we wouldn't want any of this to be interpreted as headerization.
  " (But such code would most likely be in a block quote, anyway.)
  "
  " I'm adding in the missing punctuation and we'll see how it goes.
  "
  " (What I really want is a few more 'Big' symbols that'll look good
  " as the main, top-level section. I currently use '#', which is the
  " character that uses the most ink of all available characters. But
  " I think '$', '@', and '&' could also work to convey main-sectionness.)

function! s:DubsSyn_rstSections()
  " Add the missing punctuation characters to reST header syntax matching:

  " [lb]: We use "very magic" regex to make non-counting groups.
  "
  "       See:
  "

  "
  "       Enable very magic regex:
  "
  "         /\v  \v  \v   the following chars in the pattern are "very magic"

  "
  "       See also:
  "
  "         :h literal-string
  "
  "       which explains why we use double quotes and not single quotes,
  "       because we want to use the escaped character, "\v", and
  "       not the two characters, slash and v, '\v' (or "\\v").
  "
  " NOTE: `-` must come last so it is not interpreted as range.

"
" [lb]: On a 7k-line file that takes 5.5 secs. to parse, Password15Good eats 1.75 s!

  " NOTE: \@= is Vim look-ahead. I also tried \@<= look-behind but it didn't work for me.
  " NOTE: Do this before EmailNoSpell, so that we don't think emails are passwords.
  " NOTE: Trying {15,16} just to not match too much.

" *** (p)reST(o) reST extension: reSTrule: Pseudo-Horizontal Rule Highlights

function! s:Presto_HRrules()
  " 2018-01-30: NUTS!
  "
  "   This is pretty cool. And it only serves one purpose:
  "     Making me color-happy when reSTing.
  "   That is, if I repeat the same character 8 or more times
  "     on its own line, it'll be highlighted!
  "   You can fiddle with the highlights for specific characters
  "     below.
  "   In this way, you can create more visually appealing reST
  "     documents, and you can more easily highlight section
  "     headers, as well as section delimiters!

  " - The HR match interferes with rstSections, whether it's defined before or
  "   after, and I'm not sure what's up, so only highlight when HR is followed
  "   by newlines, to avoid conflict.
  "   - (And note that `\n\n` sorta works, but the highlight only works if
  "      there are two trailing blank lines; whereas using just `\n` works,
  "      but then the top line of a real section header gets hijack-highlighted
  "      (the top line of the header should be rstSections like the header
  "      title and the bottom line of the header, but instead the top line
  "      gets a rstFakeHRAll match).
  "
  " - Note that the captured (.) character \1 matches case-insensitively.
  "   - E.g., `e` will match `E`, so
  "       EEeeeeEEEEEEeee
  "     will match.
  "   - There's probably a way to match case-sensitively but meh.
  "
  " Match lines with the same character repeating 8 or more times,
  " with optional preceding and trailing whitespace.
  syn match rstFakeHRAll   '^\s*\(.\)\1\{8,}\s*\n$'
  " Match lines of repeating `|`s.
  syn match rstFakeHRPipes '^\s*|\{8,}\s*\n$'

" 2018-09-24: (lb): Hmmm. Syntax highlighting randomly ânot workingâ,
" appears to be that it's not enabled on load. I cannot find anything in Dubs,
" or in any plugin that's calling `syntax on|off|enable`. So I'm guessing
" Vim does it automatically, but if syntax highlighting is taking too long,
" it abandons the operation. / I tried hooking BufRead to enable syntax
" highlighing, but that did nothing; and I tried using BufEnter, e.g.,
"   autocmd BufEnter *.rst syn enable
" but that causes a long âpauseâ when switching buffers into a long, few
" K lines- long reST file. So that's not an option. (And I don't think it's a
" slow syntax parse operation, because running "syn on" on its own does not
" take as long as a BufEnter syn-on. Something else fishy is happening.) /
" Finally, I'm not sure what changed; syntax highlighting had been working
" fine and fast on reST files up to 10K lines, but today I've noticed these
" issues! / Trying what ":help syntax" suggests: map syntax enable, for when
" it's not automatic. But not the toggle version:
"   map <F7> :if exists("g:syntax_on") <Bar>
"   	\   syntax off <Bar>
"   	\ else <Bar>
"   	\   syntax enable <Bar>
"   	\ endif <CR>
"map <F7> :syn on<CR>
map <F7> :syn enable<CR>
" NOTE: A trick for reload syntax highlighting: ":e", to edit the file anew.
